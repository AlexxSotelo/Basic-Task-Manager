# Basic Task Manager

A simple command-line task manager to add, complete, and view tasks. This project demonstrates basic task management features like adding, completing, and displaying tasks.

### **Created for fun and practice**

I created this project to practice Python syntax and improve my coding skills. It was a fun way to experiment with task management functionalities and understand how to work with lists and basic control flow. If you have any suggestions or feedback, feel free to let me know! ðŸ˜Š
